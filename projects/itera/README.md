# ITERA

> Simple website containing different inputs and some practice pages. This site is not a full fledged application and is a great starting point for testing.

## Aspects of the app that will be tested:

- UI tests
- Page functionality tests
- Specific E2E scenarios that cover the workflow more broadly
