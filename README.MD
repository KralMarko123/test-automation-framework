# OVERVIEW

> This is a testing automation framework containing cypress tests ( mostly e2e, the goal is to add DB & Component testing in the near future ). The goal is to not only automate scenarios but also write complete test cases for certain features thus simulating a professional setting with requirement analysis and coverage execution.

The project contains directories for each site automated and covered. The sites used were found as a reference point in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQI5x2T1RA&t=908s). Even though the plan is to use a test management tool, markdown files will be used for now.
